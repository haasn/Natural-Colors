The v0.10 release is deprecated, I do not recommend using it (instead see https://github.com/nandykins/ENB-Shaders for the preferred alternative)

The v0.9 (SES) release requires the *old* versions of Skyrim Enhanced Shaders to run (anything below 2.0). The newer (2.0 and above) versions use the preferred alternative described above.

The v0.9 (FXAA) release requires the FXAA Injector which is not included.

The v0.9 (SMAA + Injector) release includes the SMAA Injector + algorithm, which is rather slow - use at your own risk.
